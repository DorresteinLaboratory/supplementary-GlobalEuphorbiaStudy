# Files

### Cytoscape_SummaryTable_3DMolecularCartography.csv 

The file called **Cytoscape_SummaryTable_3DMolecularCartography.csv** is a summary table of the mass spectral molecular network data associated with the 3D mass spectral molecular cartography described in the the manuscript and the supplementary material.

### 3DMolecularCartography_Network.cys

The file called **3DMolecularCartography_Network.cys** is a file, which can be opened in Cytoscape version 3.4.0 ([Shannon et al., 2003](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/13/11/2498.full)) and visualizes the mass spectral molecular network and associated data from the 3D mass spectral molecular cartography as described in the manuscript and the supplementary material.

# Folders

## ClassyFire

The folder called **ClassyFire** contains R scripts and data files used for performing automated chemical classification of the <i>in silico</i> annotated structures using ClassyFire ([Djoumbou Feunang et al., 2016](https://jcheminf.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-016-0174-y)) of the mass spectral molecular network data associated with the 3D mass spectral molecular cartography.

## FigureS10

The folder called **Figure S10** contains R scripts and data files used for creating Figure S10 in the supplementary material.

## MZmine

The folder called **MZmine** contains data files retrieved from LC-MS/MS data preprocessing through MZmine 2 ([Pluskal et al., 2010](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-11-395)).

## ili

The folder called **ili** contains Rscripts and data files used for creating the 3D mass spectral molecular maps through ili ([Protsyuk et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2017.122); [https://github.com/MolecularCartography/ili](https://github.com/MolecularCartography/ili)).
